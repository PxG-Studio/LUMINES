### What's Included in Develop

The `develop` branch now includes:

1. **All Phase 0-10 Infrastructure Work**:
   - Phase 0: Turborepo structure
   - Phase 1: WIS2L migration and infrastructure foundation
   - Phase 2: Client implementation (Prisma, Redis, NATS)
   - Phase 3: API development and integration testing
   - Phase 4: Security implementation (JWT, auth endpoints)
   - Phase 5: API enhancements (pagination, filtering, sorting)
   - Phase 6: Monitoring and observability
   - Phase 7: Production readiness
   - Phase 8: Performance optimization
   - Phase 9: Code cleanup and TODO resolution
   - Phase 10: Infrastructure completion and database setup

2. **Clean Git History**:
   - All `node_modules` files removed from history
   - Repository size reduced by 87%
   - No large file push failures

3. **All Original Develop Features**:
   - Storybook hardening
   - IDE improvements
   - All existing develop work preserved

### Next Steps

- ✅ All major branches are synced
- ✅ Clean history across all branches
- ✅ Ready for continued development

The `develop` branch now serves as the unified development branch containing both:
- Original develop work (Storybook, IDE features)
- All Phase 0-10 infrastructure and production readiness work

### Repository Status

- **Total branches synced**: 4 (develop, prototype, prototype-1, prototype-2)
- **All branches**: Have clean history, no large files
- **GitHub status**: All branches pushed and up-to-date
- **Ready for**: Continued development without large file issues
