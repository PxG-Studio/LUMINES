## What's Archived

### Phases (`archive/phases/`)
All phase status files (PHASE_*.md) documenting the implementation progress of various project phases. These are historical records of development milestones.

### Status (`archive/status/`)
- Completion reports (*_COMPLETE.md)
- Status reports (*_STATUS.md)
- Implementation summaries
- Architecture scaffolds

### Docs (`archive/docs/`)
Superseded documentation that has been replaced by more current documentation in the `docs/` directory.

### Setup (`archive/setup/`)
Setup guides that have been consolidated into the main documentation structure.

### Chromatic (`archive/chromatic/`)
Initial Chromatic integration documentation, now consolidated in `docs/CHROMATIC_*.md`.

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, please refer to:
- **Main README**: `README.md` (root)
- **Architecture**: `REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `REPOSITORY_COMPLETE_OVERVIEW.md`
- **Documentation Index**: `docs/README.md`
- **All active docs**: `docs/` directory

## Why Archive?

These files are kept for historical reference but have been moved out of the root directory to:
- ✅ Keep the root directory clean and focused
- ✅ Maintain project history
- ✅ Improve discoverability of current documentation
- ✅ Reduce clutter while preserving all information

**Note**: Nothing has been deleted - everything has been moved here for organization.
