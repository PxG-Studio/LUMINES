# Archived Storybook Configurations

This directory contains legacy Storybook configurations and story files that are no longer part of the active Storybook setup.

## Current Canonical Storybook

**Active Configuration:** `.storybook/` (root directory)  
**Canonical Story Locations:**
- `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/{System}/Pages/` - Page stories
- `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/{System}/Documentation/` - MDX documentation
- `src/wissil/**/*.stories.*` - Component stories

**Start Command:** `npm run storybook`  
**Sync Command:** `npm run storybook:sync-wis2l` (runs `scripts/generate-wis2l-stories.ts`)

## Archived Contents

### `app-pages/`

Legacy app-level story files that were previously auto-generated by `scripts/generate-wissil-stories.ts` (now renamed to `generate-wis2l-stories.ts`).

**Why archived:**
- These stories were written to `src/app/{system}/*.stories.tsx` and `src/app/{system}/*.mdx`
- The canonical Storybook configuration (`.storybook/main.ts`) explicitly excludes `src/app/**/*.stories.*`
- The generator script has been updated to write stories to the canonical location (`src/stories/WIS2L Framework/{System}/Pages/`) instead

**Files archived:**
- `spark/spark.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Spark/Pages/SparkExperience.stories.tsx`
- `waypoint/waypoint.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Waypoint/Pages/WaypointExperience.stories.tsx`
- `slate/slate.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Slate/Pages/SlateExperience.stories.tsx`
- `landing/landing.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Landing/Pages/LandingExperience.stories.tsx`
- `ignition/ignition.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Ignition/Pages/IgnitionExperience.stories.tsx`
- `ignis/ignis.stories.tsx` → Now in `src/stories/WIS2L Framework/Ignis/Pages/IgnisExperience.stories.tsx`
- Plus corresponding `.mdx` files

**Migration Date:** 2025-01-XX

## Notes

- These files are kept for historical reference only
- They are not loaded by the active Storybook configuration
- The generator script (`scripts/generate-wis2l-stories.ts`) now maintains stories in the canonical location
- All references to "WISSIL" have been renamed to "WIS2L" throughout the codebase
