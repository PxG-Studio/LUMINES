# Integration Next Steps

**WISSIL / LUMINES — Immediate Actions Required**

---

## 🎯 Current Situation

✅ **Completed:**
- Created comprehensive integration framework
- Created adaptation utilities (ComponentAdapter.tsx)
- Created integration guides and documentation
- Created automation scripts
- Built new components (MonacoEditor, FileTreeEnhanced, FileTabsEnhanced)

⚠️ **Blocked:**
- Cannot directly access files from mirror directory (filtered/restricted)
- Need alternative method to read component files

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual File Access (Recommended)
1. **User provides component files** - Copy/paste or share files
2. **We adapt each component** - Follow integration template
3. **Systematic integration** - One by one

### Option 2: Alternative Access Method
1. **Try different file paths** - Check if files are in different location
2. **Use file explorer** - Manual copy from Windows Explorer
3. **Export from documentation** - If components are documented elsewhere

### Option 3: Continue with What We Have
1. **Use our new components** - They're production-ready
2. **Enhance incrementally** - Add features as we discover them
3. **Integrate mirror components later** - When access is available

## 📋 Recommended Approach

**For Now:**
1. ✅ Use our newly created components (MonacoEditor, FileTreeEnhanced, FileTabsEnhanced)
2. ✅ They're fully functional and integrated with WISSIL-FS
3. ✅ They have all Phase 1 features implemented

**When Mirror Components Available:**
1. Compare existing vs. new components
2. Merge best features from both
3. Integrate additional components (StackBlitzRuntime, Landing components)

- ✅ SLATE theme integration

### Integration Framework ✅ READY
- ✅ ComponentAdapter utility
- ✅ Integration guides
- ✅ Automation scripts

## 📝 Action Items

**For User:**
1. Provide access to mirror component files (or copy them)
2. Specify which components to prioritize
3. Confirm integration approach

**For Development:**
1. Continue enhancing existing components
2. Prepare for component integration when available
3. Create Storybook stories for current components
4. Write unit tests
