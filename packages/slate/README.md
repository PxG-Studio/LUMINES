# @lumines/slate (Placeholder)

**⚠️ PLACEHOLDER PACKAGE - DO NOT USE YET**

## Purpose

Future home for SLATE IDE/editor experience:
- Code editor panel
- Preview panel
- Engine/action selectors
- Prompt-to-asset generation UI
- AI assistant integration

This is **SLATE** (the editor surface).

## Current Status

**SLATE is production-ready and lives in `src/app/slate/`**

**DO NOT migrate SLATE code into this package yet.**

The existing SLATE implementation:
- ✅ Has complete Storybook integration
- ✅ Has Chromatic visual regression testing
- ✅ Has Percy pixel regression testing
- ✅ Has complete Playwright test suite
- ✅ Has CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci-slate.yml`
- ✅ Is fully functional and isolated

## TODO: Future Migration (Optional)

- [ ] Evaluate if migration is needed
- [ ] Create migration plan
- [ ] Test migration in staging
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
- [ ] Update CI/CD workflows

**Migration is optional - SLATE works perfectly where it is.**
