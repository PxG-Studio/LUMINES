# @lumines/spark (Placeholder)

**⚠️ PLACEHOLDER PACKAGE - DO NOT USE YET**

## Purpose

Future home for SPARK engine adapters:
- Unity adapter loader
- Godot adapter
- PICO-8 adapter
- GameMaker, RPG Maker, Construct, Ren'Py adapters

This is the **SPARK Engine Bridge**.

## Current Status

**SPARK is production-ready and lives in `src/app/spark/`**

**DO NOT migrate SPARK code into this package yet.**

The existing SPARK implementation:
- ✅ Has complete Storybook integration
- ✅ Has Chromatic visual regression testing
- ✅ Has Percy pixel regression testing
- ✅ Has complete Playwright test suite
- ✅ Has CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci-spark.yml`
- ✅ Is fully functional and isolated

## TODO: Future Migration (Optional)

- [ ] Evaluate if migration is needed
- [ ] Create migration plan
- [ ] Test migration in staging
- [ ] Update imports across codebase
- [ ] Update CI/CD workflows

**Migration is optional - SPARK works perfectly where it is.**
